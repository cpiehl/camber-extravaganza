# Camber Extravaganza

App for Assetto Corsa to show wheel camber angles in real time, helpful for tuning suspension.

Shows instantaneous and peak camber, and has an optional short-term history graph with some settings to play with.

Calculates optimal camber from config files - per car, per tire compound.  Turns blue when camber is too negative, green when near optimal camber, and red when too positive.
